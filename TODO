-- How is rhopol_chain2 defined ? Is it a linspace(0,1,21) containing sqrt(psipol/psipol_LCFS) ?
If it contains EQUI.PSIN instead, should we redefine sqrt_psin_chain2 to use the toroidal magnetic flux ?

-- Are temperatures in eV ?

-- Is ION.ANGF in [s^-1] ?

-- Make file reading more flexible (no 'name = val' required)
