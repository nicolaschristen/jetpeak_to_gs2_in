GS2 input files from JETPEAK+TRANSP databases

What the scripts do
-------------------

These MATLAB scripts allow the user to extract experimental parameters
from the two complementary JETPEAK and TRANSP databases. The user selects
a shot index in the JETPEAK DB, a radial location, a GS2 input file template,
and the name of the new file to be generated. Plasma parameters are then
extracted from the nearest lying flux surface in TRANSP (no interpolation 
to the user's input), and converted to GS2 parameters.

Example:
>> ijp = 1661;
>> psirnm_in = 0.8;
>> infile_template = 'templates/cbc_lin.in';
>> new_infile_name = 'my_newfile.in'
>> JETPEAK_to_gs2_input(ijp,psinrm_in,infile_template,new_infile_name)


Databases
---------

Snapshots of the DBs are provided under the folder 'databases/'.
As of July 2019, the databases are maintained by Henri Weisen
(henri.weisen@epfl.ch), Paula Siren (Paula.Siren@vtt.fi) and Jari Varje
(jari.varje@aalto.fi).


Picking shots from the databases
--------------------------------

In the folder 'pick_shots/', the scripts are meant to help picking a shot from
the JETPEAK+TRANSP DBs. They display the rotation and rotation shear for all
shots, and compare data from different diagnostics for a single shot.


Template files
--------------

The folder 'templates/' contains a few examples of template files. Note that
parameters in the file should be specified in the following way (including the
same number of spaces) for the MATLAB scripts to work:
'name = value'
